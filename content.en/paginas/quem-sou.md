Born and raised in Porto, co-founder of a project to raise a pair of twin girls. We do what we can. IT Engineer that became manager. Always ready to optimize the next most important irrelevance in the world. I love sports and the good things in life, like my family, good grilled fish, craft beer and a good coffee on a nice sunny day. A musician that never learn how to be it, an occasional photographer, a writer with few stories to tell. In the level immediately before "nerd", perfectly functional most of the times, obsessed with references, timeline mixtures and dystopias conveniently seasoned with the acidity of humor. A bittered believer in democracy and equality of rights, an ecologist on the rise and a feminist, because I want my daughters to live in a better world.
