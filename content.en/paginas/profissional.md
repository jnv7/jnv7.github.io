The major in Computer Engineering took me to the world of banking. I started on web development. I attained an MBA to be prepared to answer the challenges my career would pose me. I became interested in linking business with IT. Then I became an IT architect and started thinking on the purposes of produced software. I'm an evangelist for agile methodologies and obsessed with partial but valid software delivery.
