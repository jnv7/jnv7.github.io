It's 46145 yards. I'd need 3 pages to describe it. You need to prepare yourself, don't exaggerate, deal with a very hard training period, be lucky with injuries and show up at the start line. Then you live each and every one of those yards, wave to the family and friends (thank you all). And try to smile, because you're doing what you like and, even though you're not a superhero nor you're becoming healthier, it's a challenge, overcome, knowing you'll get your strength from places you didn't even knew you had when you really need it. And those who can't run, go cheer the runners, you will make a difference for someone.
