      <description>Born and raised in Porto, co-founder of a project to raise a pair of twin girls. We do what we can. IT Engineer that became manager. Always ready to optimize the next most important irrelevance in the world. I love sports and the good things in life, like my family, good grilled fish, craft beer and a good coffee on a nice sunny day. A musician that never learn how to be it, an occasional photographer, a writer with few stories to tell.</description>

      <description>I would be lying if I kept saying Porto is perfect. Far from it. But it is home. It is beautiful. And it is us who should respect and care for it.</description>

      <description>The major in Computer Engineering took me to the world of banking. I started on web development. I attained an MBA to be prepared to answer the challenges my career would pose me. I became interested in linking business with IT. Then I became an IT architect and started thinking on the purposes of produced software. I&amp;rsquo;m an evangelist for agile methodologies and obsessed with partial but valid software delivery.</description>
